excerpt: "Match throw distance to room depth so the projector stays out of the swing path and the image fills the screen."

### 1) Identify your usable depth
Measure from the screen plane to the back wall. Subtract any clearance for the enclosure frame.

### 2) Prefer short-throw when depth is tight
Short-throw projectors mount closer to the screen, which keeps the projector out of the swing zone.

### 3) Plan for cable runs and mounting
Reserve 12-18 inches for mounts and cable slack. It is easier to adjust now than after the screen is installed.

### 4) Use the calculator to cross-check
If your depth is under 12 ft, the calculator will steer you toward short-throw options.

excerpt: "Use these depth, width, and height targets to confirm your room can safely swing a driver and support accurate launch monitor data."

### 1) Start with depth, not height
Depth controls the ball flight you can capture and where the impact screen can sit. For most setups:

- **10-12 ft** is the minimum workable depth for photometric monitors.
- **12-16 ft** is the practical range for radar to behave well.
- **16+ ft** gives you flexibility for premium radar systems.

### 2) Width determines whether mixed handed play is possible
If you plan for righty and lefty golfers, the hitting position must slide. That extra movement needs width.

- **10 ft** works for a right-handed only bay.
- **12 ft** makes mixed handed play more realistic.

### 3) Ceiling height sets club safety
An 8.5 ft ceiling is a hard line for full swings. Aim for 9 ft or higher if possible.

### 4) Build in safety margins
Add 6-12 inches of buffer to every dimension. Mats, padding, and screens all take space.

### 5) If you are short on depth, plan for a camera-based monitor
Radar needs ball flight. If your room is under 12 ft deep, a photometric system will produce better data.

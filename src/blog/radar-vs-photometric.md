### Radar monitors
Radar reads the ball as it flies down range. Indoors, it needs extra depth to stabilize.

Best for:
- Longer rooms (12-16 ft+)
- Players who want outdoor range translation

Tradeoffs:
- Sensitive to short ball flight
- Often higher cost

### Photometric monitors
Camera-based units capture impact and the first portion of flight. Indoors, they deliver reliable data in tighter spaces.

Best for:
- Shorter rooms (10-12 ft)
- Garages and bonus rooms

Tradeoffs:
- Can require stickers or good lighting

### The practical rule
If your room is under 12 ft deep, pick photometric. If you have 12-16 ft or more, radar becomes viable.

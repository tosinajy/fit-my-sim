### $1,000 starter build
Focus on entry gear that keeps you swinging:

- Entry photometric or radar monitor
- Basic mat and net
- Sim software on an existing PC

### $5,000 solid build
This tier unlocks consistency and better visuals:

- Reliable photometric monitor
- Full enclosure and impact screen
- Short-throw projector
- Dedicated PC

### Unlimited build
You are paying for accuracy, durability, and immersion:

- Tour-grade monitor
- Premium enclosure + screen
- Laser projector
- High-end PC and lighting

### The biggest ROI
Spend on a consistent launch monitor and a forgiving mat first. Visual upgrades can come later.

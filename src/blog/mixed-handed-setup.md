excerpt: "A mixed-handed bay needs extra width and flexible monitor placement. These steps help you avoid awkward setups."

### 1) Target 12 ft of width
That extra width lets you move the hitting position while keeping the screen centered.

### 2) Use a hitting strip you can rotate
Interchangeable strips reduce wear and let you shift the stance box.

### 3) Choose monitors that tolerate position changes
Photometric units are easier to align for both handedness compared to radar systems.

### 4) Plan for cables and lighting
Leave slack in your cable runs so you can slide the tee position without rewiring.
